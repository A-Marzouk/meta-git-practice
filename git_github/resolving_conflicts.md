# Resolving Conflicts:

### A conflict happens when 2 developers work on the same file. first dev finished and pushed to remote branch. second dev finished and pulled the changes `Here happens the conflict` changes from remote has a risk of overwriting local changes. 
---
### We can use these commands to help resolving:
- `git log --merge`: view the merge logs.
- `git diff`: to view the differences between local and remote.
