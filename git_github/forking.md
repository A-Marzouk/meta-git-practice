# Forking

### - forking is another workflow where you can take a copy of the full repo to your account, you make the changes in a branch, and make a pull request to compare the 2 repos. not the branch with main branch.

### - you can add a fetch upstream to allow you to pull latest changes from the original repo.

### - After pushing a new branch you make a pr against the original repo.
