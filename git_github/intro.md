# Git and GitHub

### - Git: version control system to track changes of projects.

### - GitHub is a cloud based hosting service, that allows you to host and manage your repo from a user interface.

------------
### Git workflow: 3 main stages
- Modified.
    - any adding/removing/updating files will notify git. but git is not tracking it at the moment.
    - then `git add` 
- Staged.
    - once files are added, git is now tracking it and can be saved (committed)
    - then `git commit`
- Committed.
    - here you can push your changes to the remote repo.
    - then `git push`
------------------
### The way back workflow (from the remote repo):
- Changes can be fetched, checked out or merged to the working directory branch.
