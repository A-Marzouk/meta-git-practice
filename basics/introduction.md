### To avoid merge conflicts:
- in Facebook they try to make only small changes to be easy to revert.
- They also add a lot of `Gate keepers` which can allow the developer to turn on/off a feature without waiting for a rollback.
- Add a lot of tests.

### Git blame:
- `git blame` command is usually used to view the metadata of a specific line or code in a file. so that you might understand who wrote this code and what this code does and so on.
