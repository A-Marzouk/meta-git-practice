# Workflow

## Using version control without a specific workflow will cause a chaos.
- A good workflow will have a process for resolving conflicts.
- Allowing direct submission is risky, there should be review and approve.
    - An example is using the CI/CD approach: small merges, test and compile after each merge.
    - Deploy to staging to validate then deploy to production all automatically.

### Feature branching:
- it is a common workflow, where developers work on a feature branch, until the feature or task is completed. 
    - before creating a new branch, make sure you have the latest code!
- then when ready, make a pull request to the main branch.
- if approved, merge to main and delete this branch.
