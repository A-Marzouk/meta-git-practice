# Workflow

## Using version control without a specific workflow will cause a chaos.
- A good workflow will have a process for resolving conflicts.
- Allowing direct submission is risky, there should be review and approve.
    - An example is using the CI/CD approach: small merges, test and compile after each merge.
    - Deploy to staging to validate then deploy to production all automatically.
